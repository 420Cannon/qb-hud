# Things you should know:
* This menu comes with compass options however, the compass resource does NOT come with the hud. You can find it here: <br> [lj-compass](https://github.com/loljoshie/lj-compass)
* To open the menu in-game the default key is "I" or you can type "/menu"
* Your settings will always be stored locally, so even if you delete the resource it will keep your current settings. The only way you can wipe the local storage sucessfully is by clicking the "Reset Settings" button on the in-game menu
* If you want the new super snazzy sound effects for the menu, you'll need to download the latest update of [interact-sound](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/interact-sound) <br>
(comes with new open menu sound, close menu sound, click menu sound)
* If you receive 
attempt to index a nil value (global 'Lang')
 in your F8 console, the fastest way you can fix that issue is by downloading a new version via txAdminRecipe but if you are unable to do that because of the progress you’ve made on your existing build; you’ll have to unfortunately go through and download each one from the GitHub which I do not recommend. Save yourself a lot of time and pain by just downloading the recipe!

# FAQ

##
Q: How do I enable dev mode?

A: Simple! All you have to do is type /admin and navigate through the menu to the last section called "Developer Options" and inside there you should see "Dev Mode", this will keep you invincible and add a cool developer icon in your circles/radials

##
Q: What does the purple circle/radial do?

A: That is your harness indicator! When you have the item "harness" in your inventory and while in a vehicle it will appear. Also, when you use your item "harness", the circle/radial will reflect the amount of uses left and decrease overtime.
